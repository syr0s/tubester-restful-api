# Endpoint `/user/login`
Login an existing user on the RESTful API. After the successfull validation of the credentials, the endpoint will issue a new [`json web token`](../../data/jwt.md) and
sends it to the requesting client. The [`json web token`](../../data/jwt.md) is required to access protected endpoints and is valid for `10` days after issuing. It is possible to re-new the [`json web token`](../../data/jwt.md) using the [`/user/renew`](renew.md) endpoint of the RESTful API.

## `GET`

}
```

#### Response description
The response is a [`json web token`](../../data/jwt.md) which you want to use a `Bearer Token` in future requests to authenticate your users client against the database. The token is personalized, which means related to the user account which has requested the `/user/login` endpoint.
